							<h4>What is the Constitution of South Africa?</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>South Africa's Constitution (1996) enshrines
							the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. Everyone in South Africa, including the government, and all laws are subject to and must follow the Constitution.
The Constitution also contains the Bill of Rights, which it describes as the 'cornerstone of democracy in South Africa' and compels the State to 'respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights'.
 Recognising that the protection and promotion of human rights cannot be left to individuals or the government, Chapter Nine of the Constitution creates independent national institutions, subject only to the Constitution
 and the law, to transform our society from its unjust past and to deliver the fundamental rights in the Constitution to all in South Africa.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span>The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is one such national institution, which derives its powers from the 
							Constitution and the Human Rights Commission Act of 1994. It is also given additional powers and responsibilities by other national legislation. Since its inauguration on 2 October 1995, the 
							Commission has taken up the challenge of ensuring that the noble ideals expressed in our Constitution are enjoyed by all in South Africa. The SAHRC works with government, civil society and 
							individuals, both nationally and abroad, to fulfil its Constitutional mandate.</p>

							<h4>What is the Constitutional Court of South Africa?</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Constitutional Court is South Africa's highest court on constitutional matters. So its jurisdiction - the scope of its 
							authority to hear cases - is restricted to constitutional matters and issues connected with decisions on constitutional matters.
Chapter 8 of the final Constitution, entitled "Courts and Administration of Justice", sets out the structure of South Africa's court system and defines the role of each court.
Section 165 says the judicial authority of South Africa is vested in the courts, which are independent and subject only to the Constitution and the law. And section 166 identifies these courts as:
the Constitutional Court;
the Supreme Court of Appeal;
the High Courts;
the Magistrates' Courts; and
any other court established or recognised by an Act of parliament.</p>
							<p>The Constitutional Court is the highest court in the country when it comes to the interpretation, protection and enforcement of the Constitution. It deals exclusively with constitutional matters - those cases that raise questions about the application or interpretation of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court of Appeal, which used to be known as the Appellate Division, sits in Bloemfontein and is the highest court in respect of all other matters. It can hear and decide an appeal against any decision of a High Court.</p>
